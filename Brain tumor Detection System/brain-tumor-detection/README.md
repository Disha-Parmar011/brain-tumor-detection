# brain-tumor-detection
It is project of detecting Brain tumor from MRI images using deep learning.
The main goal is to classify the brain in the presence of brain tumors in a healthy brain.
The deep learning classifier improves performance and the simplify the process of medical diagnosis. 
The final result of this project is to show that if there is any brain tumor detected in the brain MRI image then it will show which type of brain tumor is there.
